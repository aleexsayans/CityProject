    <p><strong>Briew history of New York:</strong></p><br>
    <p>The history of New York developed over several centuries and began the occupation of the territory by the Amerindian populations, long before the arrival of the first settlers to what is now Manhattan. The negotiations that led to the current configuration of New York with a division into five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx and Staten Island, date back only to the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. <br>
    Before this "consolidation", n. 1 the city was the theater of operations of various conflicts, with a high crime rate. Despite this, it managed to progressively gain greater importance, to the point of constituting today the largest city in the United States and one of the most important and dynamic metropolises in the world, not only in demographic terms,1 but also as a center of decision-making of the foreground and the world capital of finance and the stock market.<br>
    The first European contacts with New York were made through Giovanni da Verrazano, who on April 17, 1524, anchored near New York Bay, before continuing his route north. Subsequently, on September 2, 1609, Henry Hudson entered the bay formed by the "Great River of the Mountains". <br>

    <p><strong>The Cocoodrile's Legend:</strong></p>
    <p>Among the urban legends there are some that have their origin long ago, this is the case of the crocodiles of the sewers, still maintaining to this day this urban legend appeared in the 30s.<br>
        Its origin is very simple, for a while in the US a stupid fashion began, having as pets alligators, brought from Florida, they were cared for in terrariums until they began to reach a considerable size, at that time the animals lost their "charm" because they constituted in addition to a danger a high economic expense. That was the time to get rid of the "pet" and what better way than to release the animal that had won the affection after time in the care of its owner.<br>
        Legend has it that the best system to release the animal was through the drain of the toilet. Small groups of these alligators managed to survive in the sewers by feeding on rats and waste and reproduced in the sewers.
        After several generations the surviving alligators mutated and lost their vision as well as their pigmentation, becoming blind and albino beings that reigned the depths of the city.
